# vba_tool_delete_unwanted_mails_outlook_2016
This VBA tool helps you clean your mailbox. It will delete the mails out of your outlook POSTVAK IN from the emailaccounts (senders) you add to the ExcelSheet. 

I figure that some mailboxes appaer with the folder Postvak IN and others with Inbox. Choose the file that suits you.
